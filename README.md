# Parallel Computing with MPI

*Please don't look at commit messages - those are pretty hard assignments to mantain with pure joy of not throwing up.* 

Assignment mostly made to provide explanation of common parallel computing coding problems like *false sharing*, *race condition* and how to avoid them.

## Project: Finding prime numbers between given range

3 most cannonical ways of finding primes - domain, functional and divisibility principles. 

## Project: Finding value of PI using Monte Carlo's method

Appliences of Monte Carlo's method for **Pi** evalution with multiple threads.
